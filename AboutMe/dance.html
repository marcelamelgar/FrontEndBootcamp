            I do dance as a way of expressing myself and doing something creative with my body. I love doing shows and even competing nationally and internationally. Throughout the years I've practiced different styles such as lyrical, contemporary, jazz, tap, hiphop, reggaeton, urban, ballroom, salsa, and bachata. It is the hobby that I've been doing for the most years.
