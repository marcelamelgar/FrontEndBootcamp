            Since I tend to do a lot of things throughout the day and I am busy most of the time with school, the apprenticeship, dance, and working out, sometimes I don't get as much sleep during the night. Therefore, I fall asleep whenever i get the chance. Even just a couple of minutes give me the boost of energy that I need to keep up with what I am  doing during each day.
