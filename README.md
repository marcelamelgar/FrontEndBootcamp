Watson Institute Front End Bootcamp.
In this repository you will be able to find some of the projects I have worked on throughtout the course.

# Front End
We have worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Kissing Cards
In this assignment I worked with CSS to make some cards do different transitions. It has been my favorite homework I have worked on so far because I think it's entertaining how some simple transitions can tell a really funny story.
